A Collaborative Microsoft Paint Tribute/Clone website built with PubNub + a bonus chatroom

The website uses:

[PubNub Presense](https://www.pubnub.com/products/presence/) To keep track of the number of "Nerdz drawing with you" 

[PubNub Realtime API](https://www.chartjs.org/) which powers that realtime chat and collaborative canvas i.e MS Paint. 

Deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) ðŸ”¥

Let's get into it.

## How to Run it 

- Clone the repository.
- Sign Up for [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/) and get your API keys in your Dashboard
- Replace the text `<secret>` in `index.html` and `app.js` with your API Keys
- Get [node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) running and install `http-server` by running `npm -g i http-server` 
- Run `http-server` in your terminal
- Get your art on...

## How it Works 
The website let's us collaborate with other users to create art in this remake of the Microsoft Paint.

To talk about your latest creation, it has an inbuilt chat to check all the nice things everybody has to say about your art.
